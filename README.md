## Environment & Dependencies

### Python

Most of the analysis was done with Python packages. I have included an environment.yml file that one can use to recreate the Python environment with anaconda. Instructions for installing anaconda can be found <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html">here</a>. Once installed you can run the following to create a conda environment and switch to it:

	conda env create -f environment.yml
	source activate galileo

For more information on conda environments see <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">here</a>. Within the galileo environment you can then run all of the Python code.
